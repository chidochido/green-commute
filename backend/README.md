## for carbon emission calculations

To get the carbon emissions of a gas car:
[url]/emissionCalc/gas-car?distance=[distance in miles]&passengers=[number of passengers]

To get the carbon emissions of an electric car:
[url]/emissionCalc/electric-car?distance=[distance in miles]&passengers=[number of passengers]

To get the carbon emissions of an electric scooter:
[url]/emissionCalc/electric-scooter?distance=[distance in miles]

To get the carbon emissions of public transportation:
[url]/emissionCalc/public-transport?distance=[distance in miles]&passengers=[number of passengers]

Example 1:
http://localhost:8080/emissionCalc/gas-car?distance=2&passengers=3
    - calculates the carbon emissions for a gas car that takes 3 people 2 miles

Example 2:
http://localhost:8080/emissionCalc/electric-scooter?distance=6
    - calculates the carbon emissions for an electric scooter that goes 6 miles
