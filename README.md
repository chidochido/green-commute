## Green Commute Web Application.

To get started and actually interact with the app, please navigate to the `frontend` directory. Ensure that a `.env` file is located inside of this folder with the contents `REACT_APP_GMAPS_JS_API_KEY=Key`, where `Key` is your key value (must be manually generated when enabling the Maps API for one of your Google Projects). Then perfom the following steps:

1) `npm install`
2) `npm start`

After executing `npm start`, you will then be redirected to your default browser where you can then interact with the Green Commute Web Application.

We are open to additional feedback to improve the user's experience while interacting with our web application. Enjoy!
